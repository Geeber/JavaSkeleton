JavaSkeleton
============

This is a barebones Java app with gradle build support. It is intended to be used to quickly start
a new Java project, or for easily testing out snippets of Java code. Simply clone the repo, add your
code to Main.java, and run:

./gradlew run

If you are using IntelliJ IDEA, you can quickly set up the necessary project files with:

./gradlew idea
